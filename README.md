# Java_Temelleri
 Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java

- Hello there. I will publish my Java notes and Java projects in this folder.
- In this folder, the subjects I learned from Udemy and the subjects I learned at university are included together.
- The reason I learned Java is that we used the Java language in the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) course we took in the fall semester of the second year of university.

> Most of my Java notes are from the Udemy course but not exactly the same because I watched the video and then tried to do what I learned.
